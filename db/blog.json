      "post": "Here we are in the middle of the second week of Evening Cohort 7 at Nashville Software School. Already I have learned a great deal and the trepidation I felt at the start of classes is starting to melt away. Coming into the course, I had some idea of what to expect from the Jumpstart course I had taken the year before, but still, people are continuously talking about how hard it is, how painful the next year is going to be, how little sleep we are going to have and so on and so on. So perhaps this is a false sense of hope, but I am feeling really good about this.<br> In the first couple days of the class, we ran through the basics of html and general structure of a webpage. I am feeling rather comfortable with that. It was one of the first things I had taught myself when I first started getting into web development. I had done the courses in codecademy.com and been through the jumpstart, and then did the treehouse courses. So, html is not a big deal. So far the biggest challenge with html is remembering to close all tags and whether to use href or src when linking files to the html document. CSS is another beast altogether. While I am slowly getting more comfortable with remembering what attributes to use, remembering the different positioning properties is difficult. I understand the basics of absolute, fixed, and relative positioning. However, in practice, to put this bluntly, this sucks. I swear, these properties only work while on school property, as soon as I get home, everything breaks. I return to the school, turn on the computer, hey look, it's working again. I don't know how to ask a question at this point, because there isn't a problem, I'm just losing my mind. Then we started learning Git Bash and git hub commands. This is virgin territory, so to speak. Treehouse covered this topic briefly, but those lessons were completely worthless without being able to actually do the thing they were teaching. The first couple of times I created a repo, I was lost. I typed letters into git bash and prayed it worked. Sometimes it did, sometimes it didn't. Now that I have had a chance to slow down and pick apart the different commands and actually utilize the tool, it's much more comfortable. I am by no means an expert, but if someone were to come up to me and start talking about it, I may actually be able to follow the conversation and hopefully add to it. I cannot begin to tell you how much just simple repetition has helped when it comes to learning the git commands. When I signed up for the program, the only true goal I had was to gain the knowledge necessary to make a career change, to get out of manufacturing, and into a job where I can actually make a difference. Now that I have been to a few classes, that desire has really blossomed. I can see the challenges that lay before me. This is going to hurt. But it will be so worth it in the end."

      "post": "JavaScript! We've done the rough review of HTML and CSS and done our homework, now on to the next challenge, which is... yep, javascript. I've heard people going back and forth about the merits of javascript and its uses. However, javascript is everywhere and like it or not, that's what we are using and are going to be using. This week I learned a new shortcut, ctrl + shift + R. It is my new best friend. This shortcut reloads the page, ignoring the cache. Every time I made a change to my code, I would tab back into chrome to see the result of my change, and nothing would happen. Refresh the page using the key in the navbar, same. No change. Ctrl + shift + r, works like magic. The three-key button press is annoying, but it works.   For actual javascript itself, we have gone from baby javascript to full-on running-face-first-into-a-brick-wall javascript. I've got the syntax of the thing, it's just wielding it in a way that actually works. I have crashed my computer several times this week with nested loops. Nested loops are a very bad idea and should be avoided whenever possible. Things will be easier once we are allowed to use functions. I don't know why, but functions just make more sense to me when completing our assignments and it took all my willpower to not use them.I did have one problem I was working on that knocked me for a loop. I just couldn't get it. Rubber Duck debugging did not help, I was stuck. I fell asleep, dreaming about evil out-of-control computers, when I woke up the next morning, I looked at the problem and solved it like I actually knew what I was doing. Going into the coming week, I pray we start doing functions. I really like functions. Although I do believe that faith in them is going to be severely tested."

      "post":"When you think about it, the things we learned in class were not really all that advanced. It was just more. The map method seems really useful. Unfortunatly it doesn't work all the time, not in ways you would expect. I tried to use it to reverse all of the strings in an array of strings, but my output ended up being undefined. Perhaps it was the way I wrote it, but even examples I had looked up were not working. I am beginning to think that perhaps I should uninstall and reinstall Chrome to see if that helps anything. It's likely to be my own fault, a comma where a comma shouldn't be, a semi colon missing, a colon where an equals would work. And now I'm rambling. So this week, my biggest problem is time and sleep. There isn't enough of either. I'm juggling three kids and family responsibilities with working full time and going to school and returning to church and it is starting to show. I'm trying to give my all to all four and there is not enough of me to go around, so I'm just mediocre in all areas. I keep telling myself there is a light at the end of the tunnel. In a years time, I will be able to leave the company I am currently at, and I will not have these class obligations."

      "post": "This past week has been pretty good in terms of balancing school and 'the other stuff that was my life before NSS'. We had a group project that actually required we work as a group, utilizing the github projects tool. At first I found it to be difficult working with other people. I wanted to just do the project and be done with it. Although I am part of a team at work, I am just now realizing what it is to work with and as a team. It shouldn't be such a big thing, but it is. The company I work for would be in a much better place if it had any of the elements our team at NSS had. First rule; it is ok to be overwhelmed. You look at the project, groan, and then move on to breaking down the problem before you. That third part is the most important bit. You don't groan, procrastinate, shove the project in a corner and then just as the deadline looms over you, throw it on a coworkers desk and hope they see it and offer to help. Second thing I learned; well, not learned, but got reinforced. It is important to slow down and actually listen to what it is your teammates are saying. Break down thier ideas, ask how they see that working. My team mates had some really good ideas; by myself, this project would have been lackluster. Third, a project doesn't have to be all work. I didn't think working in a group could be fun. I tend to take myself too seriously and I have a hard time opening up in front of others. But this past project got us really working together. We were each challenged in different ways and we really came together to work through it. Unfortunatly, our time together has to come to an end as groups are switched up this week. It's sad, but I'm excited to see what comes next."

      "post": "Week 6 at NSS and this week I feel as though I have had a cookie handed to me and then had it slapped out of my hand. I know functions. I am comfortable with functions. It's simple. function mySuperCoolFunctionName(aParameter, anotherParameter){};  I can deal with that. But now they tell us to write it const mySuperCoolFunctionName = (aParameter, anotherParameter) => {};  GAH, NOW WHAT. I probably didn't even write my sample correctly. Once we break it down, it seems easier. Instead of using var to declare our variables, we are using let and const. Const is for variables that are not going to change ever, and let is used when the variable changes within a code block. Good bye, var, we'll miss you, except for those weird instances where we have to use you because nothing else works. Rather than declaring that we are using a function, we are creating a variable with that function name and setting it equal to a whatever it is that function would do. <br>So, you are still giving a spacer variable to pass through other variables, and the action that is being taken is still in the curly braces. I don't like the arrow. The first time I saw it, I read it as equal to or greater than, but that was wrong. It is an arrow, cuz some brilliant person decided to code using pictograms. I still don't see how writing it this way is in any way shape or form more useful or clearer than the other way we had been shown. Hopefully the reason will make itsself known as I use it. <br>We also changed up groups this week. So good-bye to The Semi-Solids (after our project demonstartion on Saturday of course), say hello to The Butterworts. Or The Bottom Warts as I think we decided to rename ourselves. I think I'm beginning to see a pattern develop in the names of the groups I'm assigned to... We'll see in five weeks when groups get reassigned."

      "post": "It is Week 7 and as you can tell by the title, we discussed XHR Requests. In class I felt as though I had no idea what was going on (Yes, I realize this is an ongoing theme with me), but once again, now that I am by myself and have had a chance to pick it apart, it makes sense. I am by no means an expert and it is going to be a project or two into it before I feel completly comfortable with it, but it's all good.  All it really is doing is connecting a data page to your current project and setting it up so that you can see and use it. Believe it or not, I still really like javascript and I have started doing other little projects on the side to help reinforce some of these concepts we have been talking about. I also started getting into CodeWars a little bit. Unfortunatly, that site does not work on my work computer reliably, so I've been prowling Stack Overflow the way I used to prowl reddit during my lunch and breaks. I'm not at the point where I can actually help anyone, but soon..."

      "post": "It is week 8 and we are diving deeper into XHR requests. Sadly, I am not as confidant as I was last week. We had an assignment to call elements from a JSON file and then use different functions to manipulate those elements. I did the assignment and was very proud of myself, but then we came in that Saturday and they mentioned that we were supposed t have done it using two seperate JSON calls. That threw me for a loop. So now I have to go back in and redo the assignment. Only two of the functions I had written for that assignment are salvagable. Somehow I need to pass data through an event listener. I don't know. If I had just twenty minutes of uninteruppted thought I would have this in the bag, but as it is, my children will not leave me alone for that long. It is as though I have a light that shines everytime I start doing something that draws them to me like moths. I can't go somewhere else either, public places are too noisy and uncomfortable and the library doesn't have hours that make sense."

      "post": "I had a major problem last week that has left me behind and full of more questions than I know how to ask. Not that it would matter. The instructors are so busy with people that are further behind than me and I don't know how to ask the questions that are tumbling around inside my head. I was having a CORS issue pop up, blocking all of my XHR requests when I tried to call a bit of data off of the treehouse website. I wasted a week bashing my head against this issue. The instructors could not help me. It was not a network issue, it was not a windows issue. It all boiled down to my code, but I could not figure out where it was going wrong. I installed a plugin to chrome that helped most of the time, but still, this was not an issue I should have been having; not at this point anyway. I rewrote the project on 3 seperate occasions and then I noticed- when I copied and pasted a URL from the address bar, it added more characters than I could see. Where my address should have been https://teamtreehouse.com/amandaslayton.json, it was pasting https://www.teamtreehouse.com/amandaslayton.json. Such a stupid little thing and it was a wonder I noticed it at all. Now I know not to trust copy/paste. EVER. Once I solved that issue, I completed the project within a couple of hours. It was not as hard as I was making it out to be."

      "post": "I took a walk by myself on the trail around Couchville Lake. No children, no family, just me. It was quiet, and it was amazing. For the first time in what feels like years I had a chance to breathe and to commune with nature- as much nature as you are able to see on that trail anyway. I sat on a rock by the water, listening. I heard several species of birds, and the lapping of the waves on the jagged rocks poking out of the water, and the creaking and groaning of the trees as they began thier springtime awakening. Even though everything appeared to be still in the grips of winter and not a living thing was to seen, there were signs of new life everywhere. <br> Then it was back to reality and my responsibilities, but nothing felt so crushing as it had. I need to take more breaks like that, to return to my me."

      "date": "Monday, April 23, 2018",
      "post": "Yesterday I may have overdone it a bit. After I had gotten home from church I started coding and continued until about 10pm. I was working on the Movie-maker project that was due to be done like a week ago, but events had transpired such that I could not get it finished. It's not that I am stuck. Everytime I add a new feature or a new bit of logic, the thing breaks in way that I didn't realize was a problem. Most of my time was spent debugging and deciphering what I had written. I have discovered that I am not a very good comment writer- comments that make sense at the time were just gobblety-gook by the tme I needed to go back and review them. There are still a number of items that I need to review and last night my brain decided to continue working on the problem. However, that's when things started to get wierd. I dreamt I was working on the code, but when I looked closer at my screen, all of my variables had sprouted wings. They kept wriggling around and fluttering. Nothing would work right. Then suddenly my screen burst, releasing these creatures into my house. It was oddly beautiful, at the same time horrific. The rest of the night was spent with me trying to catch these flying alphabet centipedes and put them back into my laptop. It ws a horrible mess and when I finally woke up, I was more exhausted than when I had gone to bed."

      "post": "We demoed our Chatty Group Project today. It was a fun little project and it gave us the opportunity to play a bit more with some of the API's that exist out there. My own section of the project was getting the custom themes to work and the chatbot. I was looking at the Spectrum API like one of the other teams had used, but I wasn't all that familiar with jQuery, at least not enough to get it to work how I wanted it to, but I found another similar API- JSColor. That accomplished the same thing as Spectrum- but used just vanilla javascript. My favorite part was the chatbot though. I wasn't able to develop it as much as I liked, we were on a serious time constraint. But I was able to create a JSON file populated with five different chatbot personalities and gave them basic responses to the most common phrases typed into chatbots. I then made a random number generator that basically chose a chatbot to respond if a certain keyphrase was typed in. Simple in design, it did create the response I was looking for when it responded to my 'hello' during the demostration. <br> My group did a really good job with the other aspects. There's no way I could have figured that out myself. We had an emoji picker in the text area, a light/dark theme button, and a message limiter. We worked really well together despite the fact that we are all pretty quiet and worked better individually. It all came together into something that was impressive. If there was anything I could change, I would probably style it differently. It was black and white, the only color was the logo and edit/delete buttons. I blame bootstrap for that though. I seriously hate the look of bootstrap. It is the comic sans of webpage styling. Hopefully something else takes its place. Or maybe I can come up with something better. I don't know, so many people sing the praises of bootstrap, I doubt it's going anywhere very soon."

Things that took me a few minutes to work through with vanilla javascript have methods that can be written in a second and don't use as much resources. Now I just have to do the research and get familiar with the tools that we have been given. I don't want to use jQuery exclusively, though. Without practice I am afraid of losing what I have learned thus far. <br> This week is 'spring' break at the school. I am glad for the chance to look back at some of the things I have done and fix some of the mistakes I know I have made. And for the chance to catch on sleep. The past three weeks have been siphoning every last bit of energy I have to spare and I know the coming weeks are going to take even more ofa/ a toll. But I keep telling myself that relief is just beyond the horizon, I just gotta hold on to my sanity just a touch longer."

I do not understand what or why we are doing this or how this is supposed to help in any way. For whatever reason, we started a code-along and completed the simple part and then the instructor finished the exercise on her own and let us see it and that was supposed to make sense somehow? I don't know. This week has been one blow after another and I want to crawl into a corner and cry. About halfway through the lecture on Monday I recieved a call saying my grandfather had had a heartattack. I knew it was bad. By the time I got home that night, I overheard my mom get the news that he had passed. Tuesday was a blur. I should not have come to class, but I did. And now I do not remember it at all. Then yesterday my boss mentioned that he wanted me to apply for the quality engineer position; if I wanted the job, it was mine. If I take that position, I have to quit NSS. So I have a choice to make, NSS and a career that I may or may not be successful at, or a steady job that I cannot stand. Today I told them that I was not interested in the position. I really hope I made the right decision. Right now, looking at the coding I have just written, I am not sure."
